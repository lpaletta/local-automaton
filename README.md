# Code for "Local automaton decoder for defect matching in 1D"

This repository presents the code used for the numerical simulations in the paper "Local automaton decoder for defect matching in 1D". The code is organized into the six foolowing folders.

1. [convergence] Analysis of the convergence speed of the normalized jump rate to the logical error rate - (SM) Fig.5 (b-c)
2. [logical] Analysis of the logical error rate - (Main text) Fig.1 (a) & Fig.3 (a-b)
3. [measurement] Analysis of the effect of measurement errors - (Main text) Fig.2 (b)
4. [poisson] Verification that the logical failure behavior is Markovian Fig - (SM) Fig.5 (a)
5. [stack] Estimation of the stack size required in practice - (Main text) Fig.4
6. [trajectory] Space-time representation of the automaton - (Main text) Fig.1 (e-f) & Fig.2 (a)

Each folder includes a README.md file with more detailed information about the simulation performed for the corresponding figure.
