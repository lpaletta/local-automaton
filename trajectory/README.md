1. [Purpose](Create space-time representation of the ASR)

2. [How to use the script]

a. Set param.py to desired parameters - note that the script is restricted to ASR representation
b. If desired, set starting configuration in main.py
c. Run main.py to generate global_hist_spacetime.npy
d. Generate spacetime representations from global_hist_spacetime.npy by running spacetime.py
