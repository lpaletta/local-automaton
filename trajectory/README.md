# Create space-time representation of the ASR

How to use the script:

1. Set param.py to desired parameters - note that the script is restricted to ASR representation
2. If desired, set starting configuration in main.py
3. Run main.py to generate global_hist_spacetime.npy
4. Generate spacetime representations from global_hist_spacetime.npy by running spacetime.py
